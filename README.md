<h1>Simple Calculator</h1>
Welcome to my first GUI application built using C# and Visual Studio! This project serves as an introduction to C# development and GUI design, and I'm actively learning to improve my skills. The application currently supports basic arithmetic operations, including:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Modulus
While the core functionality is in place, there's still much room for enhancement, such as adding more advanced features, improving the user interface, and optimizing performance. I am committed to continuously refining the application as I progress in my learning journey.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or contribute to the project. Any feedback is highly appreciated!
