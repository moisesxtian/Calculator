<h1>Simple Calculator</h1>
Welcome to my first GUI application built with C# and Visual Studio! This project marks the beginning of my journey in C# development and GUI design. I'm still actively learning and working to enhance this project. Here's an overview:

**Features:**
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Modulus

**User-Friendly Interface:**
Easy-to-use graphical interface with intuitive layout

**Ongoing Improvements:**
I'm continuously refining the application as I learn more about C# and GUI development.

**Future Enhancements:**
Advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root)
Improved UI/UX design
Performance optimizations
Error handling and validation
Feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, or provide feedback. All suggestions are welcome!
